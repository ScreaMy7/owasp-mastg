## Sample

The vulnerable app fires an implicit intent with a custom action `REQUEST_FILE` to request content from another app. Since no target component is specified, any app on the device can register a matching intent-filter and intercept this intent. The attacker app returns a `file://` URI pointing to the victim's internal SharedPreferences, which the victim copies to its world-readable external cache directory.

{{ MastgTest.kt AndroidManifest.xml }}

## Attacker App

The attacker app registers an exported activity with a high-priority intent-filter matching the victim's custom action. When selected, it returns a `file://` URI pointing to the victim's internal storage (`/data/data/org.owasp.mastestapp/shared_prefs/session.xml`).

{{ attacker/EvilContentActivity.kt # attacker/AndroidManifest.xml }}

## Steps

1. Install the vulnerable and attacker app on the device.
2. Launch the vulnerable app and click "Start" to trigger the `REQUEST_FILE` implicit intent.
3. When the resolver dialog appears showing both the legitimate handler and the attacker app ("FileProvider"), select the attacker app.

## Observation

The attacker app intercepts the implicit intent and returns a `file://` URI pointing to the victim's internal SharedPreferences file containing sensitive tokens and credentials. The victim app copies this file to its external cache directory (`/sdcard/Android/data/org.owasp.mastestapp/cache/tmp`), making it world-readable.

## Evaluation

The test case fails because the app uses an implicit intent without specifying a target component, and copies the returned URI content to a world-readable external cache directory without validating the URI origin or path. An attacker app with a matching intent-filter can return a `file://` URI pointing to any file within the victim's internal storage, achieving arbitrary file read.
