[rabin2](https://book.rada.re/tools/rabin2/intro.html) is a command-line utility within the Radare2 framework (@MASTG-TOOL-0073, @MASTG-TOOL-0028) designed for extracting and presenting detailed information from binary files. It supports various file formats, including Java CLASS, ELF, PE, Mach-O, and others through plugins. Rabin2 can retrieve data such as symbol imports/exports, library dependencies, data section strings, cross-references, entry point addresses, sections, and architecture types. The extracted information can be output in multiple formats compatible with other tools, including Radare2 itself.
