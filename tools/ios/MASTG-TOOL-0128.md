Filza is a file manager for jailbroken iOS devices. It can be installed by adding the [Tigisoftware repo](https://tigisoftware.com/repo/) to your package manager and searching for Filza.

In addition to letting you browse the file system, you can also use Filza to easily install IPA files. Simply navigate to the IPA file on your filesystem, and click on `Install` in the top right corner.
