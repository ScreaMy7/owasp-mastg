title: Unvalidated URL from Deep Link Loaded in WebView
platform: android
id: MASTG-TEST-XXXA
type: [static]
weakness: MASWE-0088
profiles: [L1, L2]
---

### Overview

This vulnerability arises when an app accepts a URL from an external source such as a deep link query parameter and loads it into a WebView without validation. An attacker can craft a malicious Intent containing a deep link with a harmful URL. When loaded, the WebView executes the embedded script in the app's context, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This could allow theft of session cookies, injection of fake content, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

### Steps

1. Run a static ancalysis tool such as @MASTG-TOOL-0110 on the codebase to detect data flows from deep link parameters (e.g., `getQueryParameter()`) to dangerous sinks (e.g., `WebView.loadUrl()`).

### Observation

The output file shows a data flow where data from an Intent is used in `WebView.loadUrl()` without prior sanitization or validation.

### Evaluation

The test fails due to the application loading an unvalidated URL from an untrusted Intent extra into a WebView. A malicious application can create an Intent with a deep link containing a URL pointing to a malicious website. When this URL is loaded by the vulnerable WebView, the user is redirected to the attacker's site.
