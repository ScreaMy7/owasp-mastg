title: Signing IPA files
platform: ios
---

To install an IPA file on a non-jailbroken device, it needs to have a valid signature. On a jailbroken device, this is not required after installing @MASTG-TOOL-0127.

First, you need to obtain a developer provisioning profile and certificate, as explained in @MASTG-TECH-0079.

!!! Warning

    If you have a normal Apple account, you will only be able to sign the IPA with a modified (unique) Bundle identifier. If you have a Developer account, you can sign with the original Bundle identifier.

The signing process can be done using @MASTG-TOOL-0102, @MASTG-TOOL-0117, @MASTG-TOOL-0118 or @MASTG-TOOL-0114.

## Using fastlane

Create a directory `fastlane` and create a `Fastfile` file as described in the documentation for [resigning](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/resign/). Put both the `Fastfile` and your IPA in the `fastlane` directory.

Example:

```yaml
lane :resignipa do
  resign(
    ipa: "./filename.ipa",
    signing_identity: "Apple Development: MAS@owasp.org (LVGBSLUQB4)",
    provisioning_profile: "./embedded.mobileprovision",
  )
end
```

Afterwards, execute the `fastlane resignipa` command.

```bash
$ fastlane resignipa
[‚úî] üöÄ

[15:21:52]: --------------------
[15:21:52]: --- Step: resign ---
[15:21:52]: --------------------

| 1    | resign | 11          |
+------+--------+-------------+

[15:22:03]: fastlane.tools finished successfully üéâ
```

Once this is set up, all you need to do is change the path in the `Fastfile` for the IPA you want to resign and run the command again.

More information can be found in the official documentation: ["Codesign an existing ipa file with fastlane resign"](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/resign/)

!!! warning

    By default, fastlane will always use the Bundle identifier from the given provisioning profile, both for normal Apple accounts and Developer accounts. If you have a Developer account, you can specify the desired Bundle identifier by directly using the `resign.sh` script bundled with Fastlane and specifying the `--bundle-id` property:

    ```bash
    $ /opt/homebrew/Cellar/fastlane/2.226.0/libexec/gems/fastlane-2.226.0/sigh/lib/assets/resign.sh /Users/MAS/uncrackable1.ipa <CERTIFICATE> -p /Users/MAS/embedded.mobileprovision /Users/MAS/signed.ipa -v --bundle-id "org.mas.myapp"

    Specified provisioning profile: '/Users/MAS/embedded.mobileprovision'
    Original file: '/Users/MAS/uncrackable1.ipa'
    Certificate: '<CERTIFICATE>'
    Specified bundle identifier: 'org.mas.myapp'
    Output file name: '/Users/MAS/signed.ipa'
    Current bundle identifier is: 'org.mas.testapp'
    New bundle identifier will be: 'org.mas.myapp'

    Profile app identifier prefix is '6FZT6QZ6X3'
    Profile team identifier is '6FZT6QZ6X3'

## Using Sideloadly

Sideloadly can take care of obtaining a valid certificate for your app, but it is not possible to simply sign an existing IPA file in-place. Sideloadly will sign the given IPA file and directly install it on the connected device. When using a normal Apple account, Sideloadly will modify the original package name by appending your team identifier (e.g. `sg.vp.UnCrackable1` becomes `sg.vp.UnCrackable1.QH868V5764`)
